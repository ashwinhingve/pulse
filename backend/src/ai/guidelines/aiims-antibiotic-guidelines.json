    "content": "Acute Bacterial Rhino Sinusitis (ABRS): When to suspect: ABRS is diagnosed by any one of 3 clinical presentations: Persistent symptoms or signs, lasting for ≥10 days without any evidence of clinical improvement; Severe symptoms or signs of high fever [≥39˚C (102˚F)] and purulent nasal discharge or facial pain lasting for at least 3–4 consecutive days at the beginning of illness; or Worsening symptoms or signs characterized by the new onset of fever, headache, or increase in nasal discharge following a typical viral upper respiratory infection that lasted 5–6 days and were initially improving (‘‘double sickening’’) How to confirm: Diagnosis is mainly clinical. X ray PNS or CT scan is not recommended for acute disease. Etiology: S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae and Moraxella catarrhalis Empiric Treatment (Outpatient): Preferred: Amoxicillin-clavulanate Dose: 625mg/tab, 1 tab TDS for 5-7 days in adults Alternative: Tab Doxycycline 100 mg BD for 7 days Or Azithromycin 500 mg OD for 5 days Special remarks: Intranasal saline irrigation can be given as an adjunctive treatment Resistance to Streptococcus pneumoniae is not very common in India H. influenzae and Moraxella catarrhalis produce β Lactamases (around 23% and 75% respectively) and need treatment with betalactamase inhibitors Fluoroquinolone should not be given without ruling out TB Nonresponders Elderly, immunocompromised, and in patients with multiple co-morbidities or severe infection- treat as non-responsive patient An alternative management strategy is recommended if symptoms worsen after 48–72 hours of initial empiric antimicrobial therapy or fail to improve despite 3–5 days of initial empiric antimicrobial therapy. High dose Amoxicillin-clavulanate (875/125 2 tablets BD) or respiratory quinolones (Levofloxacin 500 OD or moxifloxacin 400 mg OD) for 7 days (after ruling out TB) may be given. Patients should be evaluated for the possibility of resistant pathogens, fungal etiology, a non-infectious etiology or structural abnormality. It is recommended that cultures be obtained by either direct sinus aspiration or under endoscopic guidance in patients with suspected sinus infection who have failed to respond to empiric antimicrobial therapy/worsened. Nasopharyngeal cultures are not recommended for the microbiologic diagnosis of ABRS. ABRS may become complicated with orbital or intracranial extension of infection, which will require imaging to guide treatment. CXR may also be needed to rule out concomitant lower respiratory tract involvement.",

How to confirm: CT or MRI of the head or sinuses and Biopsy with HPE/ KOH and culture: i. Thin, hyaline septate hyphae, branched at acute angle-Aspergillus ii. Broad, thick-walled, ribbon-like, aseptate hyphal elements that branch at right angles-Mucor. Treatment: a) Aspergillosis: Preferred: Both surgery and and systemic antifungal agents (Voriconazole/Liposomal AmB) are necessary. Voriconazole (6 mg/kg IV every 12 h for 1 d, followed by 4 mg/kg IV every 12 h; oral therapy can be used at 200–300mg BD) Surgical removal alone can be used to treat Aspergillus fungal ball of the paranasal sinus. Alternative: Liposomal AmB (3–5 mg/kg/day IV) Special remarks: Duration of therapy minimum 6-12 weeks Primary combination therapy with antifungals is not routinely recommended Therapeutic Drug Monitoring (TDM) should be done in patients receiving voriconazole (Range: 1-5 mg/L) b) Mucormycosis: Preferred: Both surgery and systemic antifungal agents are necessary. Liposomal amphotericin B (at least 3-5mg/kg/day). A lower dose can be used in cases of recalcitrant side effects for a minimum of 4 weeks May be shifted to oral Posaconazole (800mg/day in 4 divided doses) after adequate amphotericin B. Alternative: Amphotericin B deoxycholate (0.7-1mg/kg/day) Special remarks: Correction of underlying cause Duration of therapy not defined Echinocandins can be combined with amphotericin B as salvage therapy When shifting from amphotericin B to Posaconazole, one week of overlap may be beneficial Posaconazole should be administered with fatty food and cola beverages TDM for Posaconazole should be done if available.

    "title": "Community Acquired Pneumonia (CAP)",
    "category": "Respiratory Tract Infections",
    "content": "Community acquired pneumonia : When to suspect Community acquired pneumonia should be suspected in patient presenting with fever, cough with expectoration, shortness of breath and bronchial breath sounds or crepitations on auscultation. Note: No pathogen is identified in majority of the cases. How to confirm Chest X-Ray- presence of lobar consolidation/ interstitial infiltrates and/or cavitations. Confirmation of diagnosis- gram staining and culture of sputum sample. Serology for atypical pathogens may be required on a case to case basis. Blood cultures may be helpful prior to initiation of antibiotic therapy. Treatment The severity of CAP and requirement of in-patient care can be ascertained by simple scores such as CURB-65 score. One point each is awarded if the patient has Confusion , BUN > 20mg/dl, Respiratory rate>30/min, S B P<90mm of Hg or DBP <60 mm of Hg and Age > 65 years. A CURB-65 score of ≥ 2 requires inpatient care. Early initiation of empirical antibiotics is the key to the treatment of CAP as it prevents complications and decreases morbidity & mortality. Pathogen directed therapy should be started as soon as microbiological diagnosis is available to decrease antimicrobial resistance. Etiology: Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenza, Moraxella catarrhalis, aerobic gram negative bacteria, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydia pneumoniae Empirical Treatment: Inpatient (CURB-65 ≥ 2) [Inj. Ceftriaxone 1 g IV BD or Inj. Amoxicillin-clavulanic acid 1.2 g IV TDS] PLUS Azithromycin 500 mg (IV/PO) OD for 5 days Outpatient ( CURB-65 ≤ 1) Tab Amoxicillin-clavulanic acid 625 mg TDS PLUS Tab Azithromycin 500 mg OD for 5 days When risk factors of Pseudomonas are present: ( COPD, bronchiectasis, broad-spectrum antibiotics for at least 7 days in the past month, corticosteroid therapy & malnutrition) Replace Ceftriaxone with any of the following: Piperacillin/Tazobactam 4.5 gm iv QID or Cefoperazone/Sulbactam 2- 3 gm iv BD (upto TDS in severe infections) or Cefepime 2gm iv TDS or Imipenem 500 mg QID or Meropenem 1g TDS Remarks: 1. Once the etiology of CAP has been identified on the basis of reliable microbiological methods, antimicrobial therapy should be directed at that pathogen. 2. Duration of antibiotic therapy may be extended if indicated clinically. 3. Fluoroquinolones should be avoided in the treatment of community acquired pneumonia due to high burden of tuberculosis in India. 4. Macrolide (erythromycin) resistance noted in Streptococcus pneumoniae is between 9% - 20% in India. 5. Addition of empirical vancomycin: History of IV drug usage, post influenza pneumonia, severe CAP, associated skin and soft tissue infection. The following criteria can be used for diagnosing severe pneumonia : (either major criterion or 3 or more minor criteria) Major criteria: Invasive mechanical ventilation Septic shock with the need for vasopressors Minor criteria: Respiratory rate ≥ 30/min P/F ratio Multilobar infiltrates Confusion/disorientation BUN ≥ 20mg/dl WBC Thrombocytopenia Core temperature Hypotension requiring aggressive fluid resuscitation",

    "category": "Respiratory Tract Infections",
    "content": "Definitions : Hospital Acquired Pneumonia (HAP) occurs after more than 48 hours of admission and was apparently not incubating at the time of admission. Ventilator Associated Pneumonia (VAP) develops after more than 48 hours of mechanical ventilation. When to suspect The diagnosis is more often clinical with no gold standard diagnostic criteria. When a patient is hospitalized/on mechanical ventilation for > 48 hrs develops new or progressive infiltrates on a chest radiograph and has at least 2 of the following features: fever> 100.4 o F; leucocytosis (>12000/µl) or leucopenia (<4000/ µl); altered mental status with no other recognizable cause in the elderly; new onset purulent sputum or change in sputum character; worsening gas exchange (i.e. increased FiO2 requirement); new onset or worsening cough or dyspnea; rales or bronchial breathing. How to confirm HAP Respiratory samples obtained by spontaneous expectoration, sputum induction or nasotracheal suctioning and are subjected to semiquantitative cultures. Culture growth is to be considered significant if ≥10 5 CFU/ml. VAP Respiratory specimens are obtained by Endotracheal aspiration or mini bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) and subjected to semiquantitative cultures (Mini-BAL is preferred). Ideal sample collection procedure is however BAL. Culture growth is considered to be significant if ≥10 5 CFU/ml for tracheal aspirate and ≥10 3 CFU/ml for BAL. Treatment Empiric antibiotic therapy should be initiated after sending the cultures. Etiology : A) Empiric (VAP/HAP): Preferred: Cefoperazone –Sulbactam (3g IV BD) Or Imipenem-Cilastatin (0.5-1gm IV QID) Or Meropenem (1 g IV TDS) Or Piperacillin-Tazobactam (4.5 g IV QID) plus Amikacin (15–20 mg/kg IV OD) Alternative: Colistin (9MU IV stat followed by 4.5 MU IV BD) Or Polymyxin B (20000-25000U/kg loading f/b 25000 U/kg/day in two divided doses) (To be used in combination with carbapenems/ BL-BLI inhibitors) B) Culture proven VAP/HAP: -Acinetobacter baumannii, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa: Choose any one according to culture sensitivity from: Piperacillin-Tazobactam (4.5 g IV QID), Cefoperazone –Sulbactam (3g IV BD), Imipenem-Cilastatin (500 mg IV QID), Meropenem (1 g IV TDS), Colistin (9MU IV stat followed by 4.5 MU IV BD), Polymyxin B (20000-25000U/kg loading f/b 25000 U/kg/day in two divided doses) -MRSA: Preferred: Inj. Vancomycin (1g IV BD) or Inj. Linezolid (600 mg IV BD) Alternative: Inj.Teicoplanin (400mg IV BD for 3 doses followed by 400mg IV OD) Special Remarks: Levofloxacin (750 mg IV q24h) may be used as an alternative to amikacin as a second anti-pseudomonal agent. Nebulized Colistin at a dose of 2.25 to 4.5 MU twice daily or 3 MU thrice daily can be used along with IV Colistin. Colistin and Polymyxin B should be used only when there is resistance to all the other tested antibiotics. If a patient with suspected VAP has septic shock and rapidly deteriorating status, empiric MRSA coverage can be added. The choice between vancomycin and linezolid to be guided by patient-specific factors (blood cell counts, renal functions, concomitant nephrotoxic agents) De-escalation should be done once the culture reports are available. Recommended duration of therapy: 7 days if there is good clinical response or longer if clinically indicated (immunodeficiency, empyema, lung abscess, cavitation, necrotising pneumonia, etc). HAP/VAP due to P. aeruginosa who remain in septic shock/ at high risk for poor outcome when the results of antibiotic susceptibility testing are known, combination therapy using 2 antibiotics to which the isolates susceptible rather than monotherapy is preferred. Clinical picture and procalcitonin levels may be used to guide discontinuation of antibiotics. Faropenem should not be used as step down therapy in VAP/HAP susceptible to Carbapenems. Tigecycline is not recommended routinely in the treatment of VAP. C) Aspergillus Pneumonia: Preferred: Voriconazole (6 mg/kg IV every 12 h for 1 d, followed by 4 mg/kg IV every 12 h; oral therapy can be used at 200–300 mg every 12 h) Alternative: Liposomal AmB (3–5 mg/kg/day IV) Special Remarks: -Use Blot’s algorithm for diagnosis of Aspergillus pneumonia in critically ill patients. [8] -Primary combination therapy is not routinely recommended -Therapeutic Drug Monitoring (TDM) should be done in patients receiving voriconazole (Range: 1-5 mg/L)",

    "category": "Respiratory Tract Infections",
    "content": "Empyema Thoracis : Empyema is collection of pus in the pleural space. It is divided into three stages: exudative, fibrinopurulent and organizing. When to suspect Failure of a community or healthcare associated pneumonia to respond to antibiotic therapy (20- 40% cases of pneumonia have a parapneumonic effusion, and 5-10% of these parapneumonic effusions may progress to empyema). How to confirm Imaging: 1) CXR (PA view): at least 175ml is required 2) USG: Complex septated, complex non-septated and echogenic pleural effusions 3) CT Scan: Parietal pleural thickening (86%), pleural enhancement (96%) and Split Pleura sign (68%). High attenuation of the extrapleural adipose tissue in the chest wall. Pleural Fluid Analysis: Pus or positive gram stain/culture is diagnostic of empyema. Other diagnostic clues: pH<7.2, raised LDH, low glucose and high protein levels. Note: Tuberculosis needs to be ruled out in all cases (ZN stain, geneXpert, Liquid cultures, ADA levels) [ Specimens for culture should be collected during aspiration or drainage into aerobic and anerobic blood culture bottles/ RCM bottles (available at anaerobic lab, room no. 2079) and sterile containers and not from previously inserted tubes or drains] Etiology: Most common causes of non-tubercular empyema: Streptococcus pneumoniae followed by Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae type b and Enterococcus sp. Anaerobic causes are rare: Peptostreptococci, Bacteroides sp . Post procedure/ hospital acquired: MRSA and Gram-negative bacilli Treatment Principles of management: All patients with empyema need to be managed in hospital. Image guided pleural drain must be put for all patients and large bore catheters should be preferred. Tube thoracostomy should be combined with close CT or USG follow up to confirm adequacy of drainage. Persistence of any undrained fluid should prompt additional drains or more aggressive management. Ideal frequency and volume of flushing are not well established. Flushing with 20cc of sterile saline every 6 hours has shown to reduce occlusion rate. Intrapleural fibrinolytics should NOT be used ROUTINELY for complicated pleural effusions and early empyema. Management of Chronic empyema which has organised and is compromising lung expansion is mainly surgical. a) For community-acquired empyema: (No risk for MDR organism) *Cover anaerobes empirically even if cultures are negative Preferred: [ Amoxicillin-Clavulanate 1.2g IV TDS OR Ceftriaxone 1g IV 12 th hourly] plus [clindamycin 600mg IV TDS OR metronidazole 500mg IV QID] Alternative: Piperacillin/Tazobactam 4.5g IVQID b) Community acquired with risk factors for MDR- Previous antibiotic therapy, recent hospitalization, immunosuppression, pulmonary comorbidity, probable aspiration, and multiple medical comorbidities (eg, diabetes mellitus, alcoholism) Preferred: Cefoperazone/Sulbactam 3g IV BD to TDS OR Piperacillin/Tazobactam 4.5g IV QID Alternative: Imipenem-cilastatin500 mg QID OR Cefepime 2g IV TDS plus clindamycin 600mg IV TDS OR metronidazole 500mg IV QID Post procedure (Cover MRSA): Preferred: Cefoperazone/Sulbactam 3g IV BD to TDS or Piperacillin/Tazobactam 4.5g IV QID PLUS Teicoplanin 400mg IV 12 th hourly for 3 doses followed by 24 th hourly or Vancomycin 15 to 20mg/kg/dose 8 th to 12 th hourly 2 Alternative: Imipenem-cilastatin500 mg QID PLUS Teicoplanin 400mg IV 12 th hourly for 3 doses followed by OD or Vancomycin 15 to 20mg/kg/day 12 th hourly Special remarks: Presence of air bubbles within the pleural effusion in the absence of preceding pleural intervention: specific for a pleural space infection- may suggest resistance to chest tube drainage alone. A pleural pH < 7.2, LDH > 1000 IU/L, glucose < 40 mg/dL or a loculated pleural effusion predicts a complicated clinical course. Avoid aminoglycosides (inactivated in empyema fluid) Change antibiotics when culture and sensitivity reports are available Intravenous to oral antibiotic switch: If the patient has responded to therapy and there has been source control, then a transition to oral therapy can be made. Switch to oral therapy can be made only when the organism is susceptible to oral antibiotics. Switch to oral antibiotics in culture negative cases should not be done. References F.J.H. Brims, S.M.

SBP should be suspected in patients with advanced cirrhosis and ascites who develop fever, abdominal pain/tenderness, altered mental status and decreased urine output. Diagnosis of SBP is confirmed by positive ascitic fluid culture and elevated ascitic fluid polymorphs > 250/mm 3 . Ascitic fluid should be sent for bacterial and fungal cultures. Secondary Peritonitis / GI Perforation should be suspected in all patients with acute abdomen and the diagnosis is confirmed by demonstrating extra-luminal free air or contrast leak on radiological imaging. Ascitic fluid analysis will mostly show poly-microbial infection with elevated protein (>1g/dL) and LDH (>225U/L) and low glucose (<50mg/dL). Ascitic fluid should be sent for bacterial and fungal cultures. 1) Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (No risk factors for MDR) Etiology: Gram negative bacilli ( E.coli > Klebsiella ) more common than Gram positive organisms ( Staphylococcus spp., Streptococcus spp., Enterococcus spp.) Treatment: Inj.

    "content": "Skin and soft tissue infections : 1.) Impetigo: Impetigo is a superficial infection of the skin. Starts with small vesicles that turns into pustules and ruptures readily. The purulent discharge dries and forms the characteristic golden yellow crusts. Pruritus is common and scratching of lesions results in spreading of infection. Healing generally occurs without scarring. 2.) Ecthyma : It is an ulcerative form of impetigo with punched out edges. Treatment: A) Impetigo with numerous lesions, ecthyma or to control transmission during outbreaks, Bullous impetigo)- Staphyloccus aureus: Preferred: Amoxicillin-clavulanate 625mg TDS Alternative: Cephalexin 250-500 QID or Cefuroxime 250-500 mg BD If suspicion of MRSA: Preferred: Linezolid 600mg BD Alternative: Cotrimoxazole DS BD B) Non bullous impetigo- fewer lesions- Group A Streptococcus (GAS) Preferred: Topical Mupirocin BD Alternative: Topical Fusidic acid QID Special Remarks: -Blood culture is not essential -Duration: 5-7 days 3.) Erysipelas: This is a superficial infection of skin, with prominent lymphatic involvement. It is a painful lesion with bright red, oedematous and indurated appearance. It has sharply demarcated borders. Presence of fever is a usual finding. Treatment: No systemic signs of toxicity- GAS: Preferred: Amoxicillin-clavulanate 625mg TDS for 5-7 days Alternative: Cephalexin 250-500 QID or Cefuroxime 250-500 mg BD for 5-7 days With signs of systemic toxicity/Rapid progression of symptoms despite 48 hours of oral- GAS: Preferred: Injection Ceftriaxone 1-2 g IV BD for 5 to 14 days Alternative: Clindamycin 600mg TDS for 5 to 14 days 4.) Cellulitis: Acute spreading infection that involves subcutaneous tissue. Clinically rapidly intensifying pain and redness is a common presentation. Fever and lymphadenopathy may be present. The borders in cellulitis are not well demarcated. Treatment: Without signs of systemic toxicity- Staphyloccus aureus: -Tab Amoxicillin – clavulanate (625 mg) 1 tab TDS for 5 days -If MRSA suspected- Cotrimoxazole DS BD or Linezolid 600 mg BD With signs of systemic toxicity/Rapid progression of symptoms despite 48 hours of oral/proximity of lesion to indwelling medical device- Staphyloccus aureus: -Vancomycin (1g IV BD) or Teicoplanin (400 mg IV 12 th hourly for three doses followed by 24 th hourly) or Linezolid (600 mg BD) or Daptomycin (6 mg/kg OD) for 5-14 days 5.) Necrotic soft tissue infection: Erythema/edema/warmth with signs of systemic illness (fever, hemodynamic instability) and a) crepitus/skin discolouration/ foul smelling discharge b) rapid progression of clinical symptoms c) Severe pain out of proportion. Necrotising fascitis: Rapid ly spreading infection located in the fascial planes of connective tissue that results in tissue necrosis. It can affect any part of the body but is most common in the lower limb. Abdominal wall, perianal/ groin areas and postoperative wounds are the other areas that are usually affected. The affected area is erythematous, swollen without sharp margins, hot, and painful in the early stage. Within3 to 5 days after onset, skin starts breaking down developing into bullae and subsequently cutaneous gangrene. Gas gangrene: It is a rapidly progressive life threatening myonecrosis. It presents as a foul-smelling serosanguinous discharge from the wound. Crepitus is usually present. The area later turns into greenish black cutaneous necrosis. Gram stain usually shows gram positive bacilli with/ without spores. Anaerobic culture turns positive in as early as 6 hours’ time, with the growth as fast as the clinical progress. Imaging of the area may show evidence of gas in muscles and fascial planes. Treatment: Carbapenem (Imipenem 500 mg QID/Meropenem 1g TDS)/ BL-BLI inhibitor (Piperacillin-tazobactam 4.5 g QID/Cefoperazone sulbactam 3g BD) Plus, MRSA coverage (Vancomycin/ Teicoplanin/ Linezolid) Plus Clindamycin (600-900 mg IV TDS)- anti-toxin activity Urgent surgical debridement",

When to suspect Less than 50% of patients with brain abscess present with the classic triad of fever, headache, and focal neurologic deficit. In addition, the clinical presentation of brain abscess in an immunocompromised patient may be masked by the diminished inflammatory response. How to confirm CE/NCCT MRI & Magnetic Resonant Spectroscopy (MRS) Anerobic and mixed infections : along with lipid and lactate , there are peaks of succinate, acetate, lysine and multiple peaks of intracellular amino acids at 0.8 to 1.1 ppm. TB brain abscess : maybe single or multiple, ring enhancing or nodular, lipid lactate peak is seen at 1.3 ppm. Mostly associated with evidence of TB in other parts of body. Associated TB meningitis may be seen which is characterized by presence of thick basal meningeal enhancement, hydrocephalus, parenchymal infarctions and a characteristic CSF picture +/- microbiological evidence (CB-NAAT / TB culture from CSF or other samples). Nocardial brain abscess : Usually show single cystic ring enhancing or multiloculated/ multiple conglomerate lesions with a necrotic core and multilobed thick walls enhancing after contrast. MRS findings reveal lactate peak at 1.3 ppm and inverse amino acids at 0.9 ppm. Toxoplasma: In AIDS with low CD4+ ≤ 100/mm 3 , usually multiple nodular ring enhancing lesions +/- eccentric target sign, with surrounding edema, predominantly in basal ganglia, Toxoplasma IgG usually +ve, therapeutic response to Cotrimoxazole (TMP/SMX).

    "category": "Cardiovascular Infections",
    "content": "Native valve endocarditis: Based on review of recent articles on data of infective endocarditis from India, the most common organisms associated with native valve endocarditis (pooled data) are as follows: Streptococci predominantly viridans group (28.6%) Staphylococci spp. (12.2 %) - MRSA is variable from (0 % to 52%) Enterococci spp. (5.2%) Gram negative bacilli (5.1%) Culture negative (45%) When to suspect : - Native valve endocarditis should be suspected in any patient with unexplained fever, night sweats, or signs of systemic illness with or without known valvular heart disease. How to confirm – Blood cultures should be obtained before initiation of antibiotic therapy. In critically ill patients, a minimum of three cultures from different venipuncture sites should be drawn over one hour before starting empiric therapy. In non–critically ill patients in whom endocarditis is suspected, therapy may be delayed until the results of blood cultures and echocardiography are available. Obtaining more than three blood cultures typically yields only minimal additional diagnostic information. Baseline electrocardiography should be performed in patients with infective endocarditis so that new cardiac manifestations can be recognized early (e.g., extension of valvular disease into the conduction system, ischemia secondary to emboli to the coronary circulation). Echocardiography should be performed to identify valvular abnormalities in all patients in whom there is moderate or high suspicion of endocarditis. Transthoracic echocardiography is usually the initial imaging modality but has a modest sensitivity only. However, transesophageal echocardiography may be necessary in some patients, such as those with staphylococcus bacteremia, limited transthoracic windows because of obesity or mechanical ventilation, a prosthetic valve that renders visualization difficult secondary to shadowing, a history of endocarditis, or a structural valve abnormality. Modified Dukes criteria for infective endocarditis Definitive Infective Endocarditis Pathologic Criteria Microorganisms demonstrated by culture or histologic examination of a vegetation, a vegetation that has embolized, or an intracardiac abscess specimen;

Patients presenting with AFI should be assessed for organ dysfunction at presentation and symptoms/signs suggestive of sepsis should be ruled out as management protocol will differ. Most common causes of AFI have been covered below with their specific treatment options. Note: Patients presenting with AFI (> 2 days duration) should undergo a baseline investigation (CBC/ESR/Peripheral smear/LFT/etc) as deemed necessary by the treating physician, apart from the usual screen for common causes of tropical fever (discussed below). All patients with organ dysfunction should be managed inpatient.

    "category": "Febrile Illness & Bloodstream Infections",
    "content": "Blood Stream Infections : Definitions A central line is an intravascular access device or catheter that terminates at or close to the heart, or in one of the great vessels. The line may be used for infusion of intravenous fluids and drugs, or for haemodynamic monitoring. Central line (CL) infection can be local (e.g. phlebitis) or systemic. Catheter-related bloodstream infection (CRBSI) is bloodstream infection (BSI) attributed to an intravascular catheter by quantitative culture of the catheter tip or by differences in growth between catheter and peripheral venipuncture blood culture specimens. This definition is primarily used in research. The BSI should not be related to an infection at another site. Central Line Associated Bloodstream Infections (CLABSI) is defined as a laboratory-confirmed BSI where an eligible blood stream infection organism is identified, and an eligible central line is present on the day/ day before the event. Eligible Central Line: A CL that has been in place for more than 2 consecutive calendar days, following the first access of the central line, in an inpatient location, during the current admission. Such lines are eligible for CLABSI events and remain eligible for CLABSI events until the day after removal from the body or patient discharge, whichever comes first. When to suspect CLABSI should be suspected in patients with: Fever in a patient with a central venous catheter with no other apparent source Erythema, induration or tenderness within 2 cm of the catheter exit site Catheter dysfunction (intraluminal clot) Clinical signs of sepsis that start abruptly after catheter insertion Diagnosis : Confirmation of CLABSI requires both a positive blood culture and a collaborative clinical and microbiological review of the patient. Blood culture should be obtained prior to initiation of antibiotic therapy. Paired blood samples, drawn from the catheter and a peripheral vein, should be sent for culture, and the bottles should be appropriately marked to reflect the site from which the samples were obtained. If a blood sample cannot be drawn from a peripheral-vein, it is recommended that 2 blood samples should be drawn through different catheter lumens. The case definition for BSI (must meet one of two criteria): Criterion 1: Patient has a recognized pathogen cultured from one or more blood culturesAND Organism cultured from blood is not related to an infection at another site Criterion 2: Patient has at least one of the following signs or symptoms: fever (>38°C) or hypotension AND Common skin contaminant is cultured from two or more blood cultures drawn on separate occasions Establishing diagnosis of CRBSI requires presence of BSI and demonstrating that the infection is related to the catheter. The catheter tip should be cultured and growth of >15 colony-forming units (cfu) from a 5-cm segment tip by semiquantitative (roll-plate) culture, or growth of >10^2 cfu by quantitative (sonication) broth culture of the same pathogen as in peripheral blood culture supports the diagnosis of CRBSI. Further, culture of the same organism from at least 2 blood samples (1 from catheter, 1 from peripheral vein) meeting criteria for quantitative blood cultures or differential time to positivity can be used for diagnosing CRBSI. Treatment : Empiric antibiotic therapy must be started in sick patients (hypotension, organ dysfunction) in suspected CLABSI before culture and susceptibility reports are available. Treatment should be appropriately modified after the culture and susceptibility report. Systemic antibiotic therapy is usually NOT required if: 1. Positive catheter tip culture in absence of clinical signs of infection. 2. Positive blood cultures from the catheter with negative cultures through the peripheral vein, in absence of clinical signs of infection. 3. Phlebitis in absence of signs of infection.",

The organ dysfunction is represented by an acute increase in the Sequential [Sepsis-related] Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score of 2 points or more (with the baseline assumed to be 0 in patients without any known preexisting organ dysfunction). Septic shock is a subset of sepsis in which particularly profound circulatory, cellular, and metabolic abnormalities are associated with a greater risk of mortality than with sepsis alone. Clinically they are identified by a vasopressor requirement to maintain mean arterial pressure of ≥ 65 mmHg and serum lactate level greater than 2 mmol/L (>18mg/dL) in absence of hypovolemia. When to suspect Adult patients with suspected infection can be quickly screened for likelihood of having poor outcomes typical of sepsis, if they have at least 2 of the following 3 clinical criteria: (qSOFA) respiratory rate of 22/min or greater altered mentation systolic blood pressure of 100 mmHg or less. Diagnosis In patients with suspected sepsis or septic shock, appropriate routine microbiologic cultures (blood, respiratory secretions, urine, cerebrospinal fluid, wounds, and other body fluids) should be obtained before initiation of antimicrobial therapy from all potential sites of infection. If it is not logistically possible to obtain cultures promptly (45 minutes), the appropriate antimicrobials should be administered. Management Sepsis management is simplified by using the “ bundle ” approach. ​ The 1 st hour of the patient with sepsis and septic shock within the healthcare facility is the GOLDEN HOUR. Measure lactate level. Remeasure if initial lactate level > 2 mmol/L. Obtain blood cultures before administering antibiotics. Administer broad-spectrum antibiotics. Begin rapid administration of 30mL/kg crystalloid for hypotension or lactate level ≥ 4 mmol/L. Apply vasopressors if patient is hypotensive during or after fluid resuscitation to maintain MAP ≥ 65 mm Hg.",

Treatment duration of 7 to 10 days is adequate for most cases. Longer courses appropriate in slow clinical response, undrainable foci of infection, bacteremia with S aureus, some fungal and viral infections, or immunologic deficiencies. Measurement of procalcitonin levels can be used to support shortening the duration of antimicrobial therapy. Risk factors for invasive candida infections include immunocompromised status (neutropenia, chemotherapy, transplant, diabetes mellitus, chronic liver failure, chronic renal failure), prolonged invasive vascular devices (hemodialysis catheters, central venous catheters), total parenteral nutrition, necrotizing pancreatitis, recent major surgery (particularly abdominal), prolonged administration of broad-spectrum antibiotics, prolonged hospital/ICU admission, recent fungal infection, and multisite colonization.Triazoles are acceptable in hemodynamically stable, less ill patients who have not had previous triazole exposure and are not known to be colonized with azole-resistant species.",

Secondary goal: to reduce health care costs without adversely affecting the quality of care. Figure: ASP goals : --> Antibiotic Time-out : A concrete point in time dedicated to reviewing antimicrobial choice and duration Reappraise therapy when more clinical data are available (usually in 48-72 hours) Decide about continuation, narrowing therapy and specify a duration Recommended changes are better received and more likely to be followed at a later time point The essence of antimicrobial stewardship: (MINDME) M: Microbiology guides therapy wherever possible I: Indications should be evidence based N: Narrowest spectrum required D: Dosage appropriate to the site and type of infection M: Minimize duration of therapy E: Ensure monotherapy in most case",

    "content": "Introduction to Antimicrobials : Antimicrobials are chemicals that inhibit the growth or kill microorganisms. They can be classified into bactericidal and bacteriostatic drugs. Bactericidal antibiotics: Antibiotics that work by killing microorganisms do it by interfering with the structure of the cell wall of the bacterium or parasite. Example: Penicillins, Cephalosporins, Fluoroquinolones, Glycopeptides, Monobactams, Carbapenems Bacteriostatic Antibiotics: Antibiotics that work by inhibiting the growth of organisms Examples: Tetracyclines, Sulphonamides, Macrolides, Chloramphenicol, Trimethoprim The mechanisms of various antibiotics are illustrated in the image given below link Figure: Antibiotic target sites :--> Figure: Classification of Beta-lactam antibiotics:--> Pearls about beta lactam usage Penicillins Penicillins: aqueous and benzathine penicillin Coverage: Streptococci, basic anaerobes (e.g., non-difficile Clostridium spp), syphilis (Treponema pallidum) Aminopenicillins: ampicillin, amoxicillin Coverage: Drug of choice for Enterococci, Streptococci, basic anaerobes, Listeria monocytogenes, not MSSA Anti-Staphylococcal Penicillins aka Penicillinase-resistant penicillin: cloxacillin, dicloxacillin Coverage: Methicillin Sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) Penicillin/BLI (Beta lactamase inhibitor) combinations: amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, piperacillin-tazobactam Coverage: Streptococci, Enterococci, MSSA, Gram negatives (more with pip/taz, which also has Anti-Pseudomonal activity), anaerobes (including Bacteroides fragilis) Cephalosporins (Limited coverage versus anaerobes & Enterococci) 1st gen: cephalexin Coverage: Streptococci, MSSA, Proteus, Klebsiella, E.coli 2nd gen: cefuroxime (IV/Oral) Coverage: Streptococci, MSSA, Haemophilus influenzae, Neissseria, Proteus, E. coli, Klebsiella 3rd gen: ceftriaxone (IV), ceftazidime (IV), cefixime, cefotaxime, cefpodoxime Coverage: Streptococci (better than 1st or 2nd gen), MSSA (not as good as 1st or 2nd gen), broad gram-negative coverage (ceftazidime even has anti-pseudomonal activity) 4th gen: cefepime (IV) Coverage: Streptococci (better than 1st or 2nd gen), MSSA, broad Gram-negative coverage (better than 3rd gen) and has Pseudomonas activity, also active against Amp-C producers “ 5th” gen: ceftaroline (IV) Coverage: Like ceftriaxone with MRSA coverage Cephalosporin combinations: Cefoperazone-sulbactam Coverage: Additional activity on MDR Acinetobacter spp, Pseudomonas spp. Carbapenems: Imipenem v/s Meropenem: Coverage: MSSA, GAS and Pneumococci , anaerobes, gram negative organisms Imipenem is better than Meropenem for Nocardia but inferior for Citrobacter and Burkholderia cepacia complex. Aztreonam: Is a good drug for gram negative aerobes, but a poor choice for anaerobes and gram-positive bacteria Note: Drugs like Ceftriaxone -sulbactam-EDTA and Faropenam are available, however, evidence is not sufficient for their routine use ANTIFUNGALS Based on mechanism of action systemic antifungals can be divided into three groups. They are Acting on cell wall: Echinocandins (Caspofungin, Anidulafungin, Micafungin) Acting on cell membrane: Azoles (Fluconazole, Itraconazole, Voriconazole, posaconazole), Polyenes (Amphotericin B) Inhibiting protein synthesis: 5 Flucytosine Spectrum of activity of antifungals Organism Ampho B Flu Itra Vori Posa Mica/Anid/Caspo Aspergillus sp. +/- - + + + + Candida albicans + + + + + + Candida glabrata + +/- +/- + + + Candida krusei + - +/- + + + Candida lusitaniae - + + + + + Candida parapsilosis + + + + + +/- Cryptococcus neoformans + + + + + - Coccidiodes spp. + + + + + - Histoplasma spp. + + + + + - Fusarium spp. +/- - - +/- +/- - Mucormycetes +/- - - - + - ANTIVIRAL AGENTS Agents for treatment of HSV and VZV Acyclovir is selectively activated in HSV or VZV-infected cells to acyclovir diphosphate and triphosphate by cellular enzymes which are a potent, irreversible inhibitor of the DNA polymerases of HSV types 1 and 2 and VZV. Valacyclovir is a prodrug and is converted to acyclovir in vivo. Famciclovir is an oral prodrug of the antiviral agent penciclovir. Penciclovir exerts its antiviral effects by inhibiting DNA polymerase, in a similar manner to that of acyclovir. Agents for treatment of CMV Ganciclovir triphosphate inhibits CMV DNA polymerase and is incorporated into CMV DNA, eventually terminating elongation and replication. In HSVand VZV-infected cells, ganciclovir is phosphorylated by virus-encoded thymidine kinases. Agents for treatment of Influenza Oseltamivir belongs to the neuraminidase inhibitor (NAI) class of antiviral drugs. Treatment for influenza (when indicated): Oseltamivir 75mg BD x 5 days, to be initiated within 48-72hrs of symptoms. Dose modification is required in renal dysfunction. Summary of antivirals: Acyclovir Route Oral, IV, topical Typical frequency 3-5x/day Renal adjust CrCl < 50 Other notes Renal crystaluria with high-dose IV; dose using IBW in obesity Valacyclovir Route Oral Typical frequency 1-2x/day Renal adjust CrCl < 50 Other notes Less frequent dosing means better adherence Famciclovir Route Oral Typical frequency 2-3x/day Renal adjust CrCl < 60 Other notes Tablets not recommended for patients with galactose intolerance",

    "title": "Specimen Collection Guidelines",
    "category": "General",
    "content": "Specimen Collections and Transport : General Principles: Selection of the appropriate anatomic site for obtaining the specimen. Collection of the specimen using the appropriate technique. Collection of the samples, preferably before starting of the antibiotics. Prevention of contamination of the specimen with the externally present organisms or normal flora. Packaging the sample properly stoppered and plugged, without leakage, proper handling of the samples and not posing any safety hazard. Expedite transport of the specimen to the lab, or if required to store the sample, storage should be brief and properly done, at a temperature that does not damage the suspected organism. Appropriate containers for the collection of the samples: Blood: - Automated blood culture bottle or Screw-capped blood culture bottles Urine: Sterile wide mouthed screw-capped container Sputum: Sterile wide mouth container CSF, Pleural fluid, pericardial fluid, peritoneal fluid/ other fluids- Blood culture bottle or Sterile puncture proof, spill proof vial Faeces- Clean wide mouth container Swabs from throat/ wound /discharge/ high vaginal swab- Sterile swabs, to be sent in sterile vials. Tissues- Sterile container, put sample in normal saline, not in formalin. A. BLOOD: Preparation of site: Vigorous Cleaning of the site with70% ethyl alcohol (or sterilium, 75% propranolol), from centre to outward in a circular fashion, allow to dry. Apply povidone iodine in a similar fashion and allow to dry. Recommended blood volume : Adult patient: 20 ml divided between 2 blood cultures(10ml each) from separate peripheral venipuncture sites. Suspicion of Infective endocarditis: 3 blood culture sets with the 1 st and last drawn at least one hour apart (within a 30 min period of administration of empirical antibiotics). In cases of suspected catheter related sepsis, two blood culture sets are drawn, one set is obtained from the suspected catheter and at the same time, a second set must be from a separate peripheral site. The time of collection should be noted for both specimens. If the catheter is removed, a section of about 1 inch in length from an intradermal portion is to be cut aseptically and sent to Microbiology Lab in a dry sterile container. Catheter tip without sending concomitant blood cultures is not recommended. Timing of blood cultures: Volume is more important than timing of blood culture in patients with suspected septicemia. Thoroughly mix the contents of the bottle to avoid clotting. Transport of blood Culture bottles : In case of delay between collection and processing, never refrigerate the bottle. Keep it at 35C incubator if available. Otherwise, leave it at room temperature. B. Bone Marrow: Bone marrow aspirate is obtained with aseptic precautions, percutaneously using a sterile needle and syringe. 3-5 ml is transferred for culture into a blood culture bottle - do not send in a Heparin tube. For fungal culture, sample is sent in a fungal blood culture bottle. Transport precautions are similar as those for blood specimen transport. C. CSF: Disinfect the puncture site with the same antiseptic precautions as for blood culture, in order to avoid introduction of infection and avoidance of specimen contamination. CSF to be collected in sterile, labelled vials. If ventricular shunt fluid being sent, label it as “ventricular shunt fluid” and not CSF (as isolates that could be considered as contaminants if obtained from LP may be responsible for shunt related infections). After collection, transport it to the lab immediately. If any delay expected, keep it at 35C incubator if available or else keep it at room temperature. DO NOT REFRIGERATE. D. Other sterile body fluids: Ascites, Pleural fluid, Pericardial fluid, Peritoneal fluid: Collect the fluid under aseptic conditions as for CSF and blood . Container similar to the one used for CSF. Label the specimen, about the specific type of fluid and what studies are to be done. After collection, transport it to the lab immediately. DO NOT REFRIGERATE. E. GI specimen: Stool/Faeces for Culture/ Parasitology studies: Instruct the patient who can, to directly excrete into the cup/collection device. Alternatively, can collect feces from sterile bed pan/ plastic wrap/ paper and place 10-20 g in the container. Never collect the sample from water in a toilet/ don’t allow urine to contaminate the specimen. Collect the sample in clean, wide-mouthed, screw capped containers. A single stool specimen may not exclude bacterial or parasitic pathogens as the cause of diarrhea and at least 3 samples should be collected. Transport: For bacterial culture, if the specimen is not transported immediately, refrigerate it or use special media (to contact bacteriology laboratory) Note: For parasitological examination, submit the sample as quickly as possible . F. Respiratory specimen: Upper Respiratory tract Infections: Pharyngitis: Usually detection of organism not routinely done. Throat swab: Used in case of pharyngitis and suspicion of influenza. Streptococcal screening may reveal beta-hemolytic streptococci, Haemophilus, Strep. pneumonia, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Staph.aureus. In case of suspected and confirmed gonococcal infection, pharyngeal swab has to be taken. For viral agents, throat swab, and nasal swab to be sent in viral transport medium, to the lab within 30 min or store in 4 o C. Laryngitis: Usually viral etiology, throat swab, and nasal swab sent in the above conditions. Lower Respiratory tract infections: Careful collection of the sample, without contamination with the oropharyngeal flora is essential. Sputum: First early-morning specimen, produced after a bout of cough is preferred. To be collected in a sterile screw-capped container. To be transported to the lab within 2 hours. Avoid contamination or soiling of the outside of the container. Bronchoscopy- BAL: Collected via bronchoscope, bronchial brushings are preferred over bronchial washings. Label the sample properly, along with the time of collection, and the procedure performed. Send to the lab quickly, do not refrigerate. Mini-BAL: Precautions similar as for BAL but this is a blind procedure. Endo-tracheal aspirate: Precautions similar as for BAL. Dilution of the specimen with excessive amount of saline is undesirable. Nasal swab: Used for MRSA (Methicillin Resistant S.aureus ) screening and in cases of suspected influenza. For influenza, sample to be sent in viral transport medium to the virology lab within 30 min or store in 4 o C. Nasopharyngeal swab: Routine use in bacterial culture is not recommended. Not to be used to detect agent causing a sinus infection. Used primarily to diagnose whooping cough and detect meningococcal carriers. G. Urine specimen Urine: First morning, mid-stream, clean-catch urine collected in a sterile screw-capped container is the sample of choice.In catheterized patients, clamping the catheter tubing to collect urine in the tube, for a maximum of 30 min, cleaning of the sampling port or tubing site with alcohol swabs is done. Then the needle is inserted into the tubing port and urine is withdrawn into the syringe. The specimen needs to be refrigerated if not sent to the lab within 30 min. Foley- catheter tip and sample from the catheter bags at the bedside are unacceptable samples. Suprapubic aspirate: Used in patients with spinal cord injury, obstructive uropathy and patients from whom a definitive culture cannot be obtained. This sample avoids contamination of urine with urethral or perineal bacteria. Method: Decontamination of the skin from umbilicus to urethral meatus, anaesthesize the skin at the insertion site, introducing the needle into the full bladder at the mid-line between the pubic symphysis and umbilicus, 2 cm above the symphysis. Skin and Contiguous tissue specimen: Specimen of choice depends on the extent and character of the lesion. For most open lesions, removal of superficial flora by decontamination, before collecting specimen from the advancing margin or base is essential. For dry encrusted lesions, culture not recommended unless exudate is present. For a closed abscess, the exudate and the sample from the abscess wall is desired. For burn wounds, culture only after extensive cleaning and debridement is desired. Biopsy specimens are preferable. The specimen of choice is taken from the advancing margin of the lesion, firmly with a swab, and not just pus or exudate. Removal of the exudate is essential to reach the interior of the lesion. Wound specimen: Attention to skin decontamination is very important. The representative sample is taken from the advancing margin of the lesion, firmly with a swab, and not just pus or exudate. Samples from surface wounds cannot be used for anaerobic culture, but those from deep wounds can be used. For anaerobic culture, specimen of choice is an aspirate, not a swab. Anaerobic transport media to be requested for submitting anaerobic cultures Figure: Common sample collection containers",
